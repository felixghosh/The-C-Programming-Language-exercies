# The C Programming Language Exercises
## _My solutions_

Hopefully these can come in handy for other people going thorough the exercises in K&R's book 'The C Programming Language'. Some of these may not have been fully tested other than me trying to print the expected output once or twice, so please don't fault me if all soultions are not 100% correct.
